# 🐾 Civic Animal Protocol v0.1  
_— Defining Nonhuman Citizens in Ecological DAOs_

## 📘 Summary

This protocol defines the **“Civic Animal”** — a new ecological and social designation for nonhuman species who:

- Observe and mimic human-led agricultural or environmental tasks
- Participate voluntarily in shared environmental labor (e.g. weed removal, planting)
- Receive healthcare, reward, or shelter through DAO-aligned infrastructure
- Behave according to learned or mimicked **normative protocols**

The Civic Animal exists **between wild and domestic**, forming a third category:  
➡️ _An autonomous participant in ecological systems governed by logic, media, and reward feedback._

## 🧬 Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `Civic Animal` | A nonhuman organism who learns & follows visual/behavioral protocols tied to ecological DAOs |
| `Participation Zone` | Physically marked area (tape/flag/LED) indicating approved action space (e.g. green = weed, red = no-eat) |
| `Reward Cue` | Non-verbal positive feedback (e.g. shimmer light, pellet drop, soft tone) used to reinforce learned behavior |
| `Accredited ID` | Visible marker (ear tag, collar, band) showing DAO participation and identity/tracking readiness |
| `Citizen Log` | Time-stamped action records tied to zone behavior, mimic actions, rewards, healthcare access |

---

## 🧠 Core Criteria

To qualify as a *Civic Animal*, the following must be met:

- ✅ **Visual protocol comprehension** (via repeated exposure to monitor content or mimicry)
- ✅ **Targeted behavior performance** (weed removal, tool mimicry, safe zone respect)
- ✅ **Reward feedback usage** (token, food, gesture)
- ✅ **Voluntary approach** (not trapped or forced)
- ✅ **ID accessory worn or tolerated** (band, tag, etc.)
- ✅ **No harmful behavior toward other civic participants**

## 🏞️ Layered Participation Zones

| Zone Type | Function | Actor |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| 🌱 Green | Action-permitted (weeds, tools, earth) | mimic, interact |
| 🔴 Red | Protected (crops, nests, human gear) | avoid, detour |
| 💠 Blue | Civic Service (water, vet-care, salt lick) | rest, repair |
| 🪙 Gold | Reward dispenser (rare, intermittent) | reinforce correct behavior |
