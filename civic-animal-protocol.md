# 🐾 Civic Animal Protocol v0.1  
_— Defining Nonhuman Citizens in Ecological DAOs_

## 📘 Summary

This protocol defines the **“Civic Animal”** — a new ecological and social designation for nonhuman species who:

- Observe and mimic human-led agricultural or environmental tasks
- Participate voluntarily in shared environmental labor (e.g. weed removal, planting)
- Receive healthcare, reward, or shelter through DAO-aligned infrastructure
- Behave according to learned or mimicked **normative protocols**

The Civic Animal exists **between wild and domestic**, forming a third category:  
➡️ _An autonomous participant in ecological systems governed by logic, media, and reward feedback._

## 🧬 Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `Civic Animal` | A nonhuman organism who learns & follows visual/behavioral protocols tied to ecological DAOs |
| `Participation Zone` | Physically marked area (tape/flag/LED) indicating approved action space (e.g. green = weed, red = no-eat) |
| `Reward Cue` | Non-verbal positive feedback (e.g. shimmer light, pellet drop, soft tone) used to reinforce learned behavior |
| `Accredited ID` | Visible marker (ear tag, collar, band) showing DAO participation and identity/tracking readiness |
| `Citizen Log` | Time-stamped action records tied to zone behavior, mimic actions, rewards, healthcare access |

---

## 🧠 Core Criteria

To qualify as a *Civic Animal*, the following must be met:

- ✅ **Visual protocol comprehension** (via repeated exposure to monitor content or mimicry)
- ✅ **Targeted behavior performance** (weed removal, tool mimicry, safe zone respect)
- ✅ **Reward feedback usage** (token, food, gesture)
- ✅ **Voluntary approach** (not trapped or forced)
- ✅ **ID accessory worn or tolerated** (band, tag, etc.)
- ✅ **No harmful behavior toward other civic participants**

## 🏞️ Layered Participation Zones

| Zone Type | Function | Actor |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| 🌱 Green | Action-permitted (weeds, tools, earth) | mimic, interact |
| 🔴 Red | Protected (crops, nests, human gear) | avoid, detour |
| 💠 Blue | Civic Service (water, vet-care, salt lick) | rest, repair |
| 🪙 Gold | Reward dispenser (rare, intermittent) | reinforce correct behavior |

## 📋 Logging Schema (JSONL example)

```json
{
  "ts": "2025-11-10T08:41:22+09:00",
  "species": "macaca_fuscata",
  "id_tag": "JP-MF-0139",
  "zone": "green",
  "action": "digging",
  "reward_dispensed": true,
  "accessory": "collar_orange",
  "health_check": "normal",
  "notes": "dug near carrot patch, avoided red-zone rope"
}

---

🧰 Minimum Required Infrastructure
	•	✅ Small outdoor display (10–40”) looping mimic-friendly media
	•	✅ Physical zone marking (color flags, rope, scent, texture)
	•	✅ Optional micro-reward dispenser (3s delay max)
	•	✅ Accessory attachment (non-invasive ID tags)
	•	✅ Camera logger (IR/night optional)
	•	✅ Optional small health tent/vet area

⚖️ Civic Rights of the Participant Animal

Right	Description
🌿 Non-Harassment	May not be hunted, chased, or harmed inside protocol zone
🏥 Basic Care Access	Parasite removal, wound treatment, grooming
🎥 Media Participation	Actions may be recorded for DAO log, not entertainment
⛩ Sanctuary Recognition	Treated as a cooperative species, not nuisance


⸻

💠 Symbolic Accessories

Type	Meaning
🟢 Ear Tag (Green)	Weed-DAO certified
🔵 Collar (Blue)	Medical-care access granted
🟣 Band (Purple)	Non-aggression pact (learned)
🟡 ID Charm	Voluntary return tracked

Animals may choose accessory types via repeated exposure to footage or opt-in zones.

⸻

📜 Open Questions for v0.2
	•	Can behaviors be transferred across kin groups or generations?
	•	How to handle interspecies cooperation vs competition?
	•	What counts as “consent” in accessory wearing or zone entry?
	•	How do we evaluate citizenship decay (failure to return, aggression)?
