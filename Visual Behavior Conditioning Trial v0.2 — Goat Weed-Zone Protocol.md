# 🐐 Visual Behavior Conditioning Trial v0.2 — Goat Weed-Zone Protocol

**Speculative Animal Training Protocol using AI-generated or staged visuals.**

## Objective

Teach goats to:
- Preferentially graze in "green" zones (weed zones)
- Avoid "red" zones (crop zones)
Using **looped visual stimuli** + **mild reward reinforcement** via pellet dispensers.

## Components

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🎞️ Visual | Green/Red tape visuals + staged goat footage |
| 🖥️ Hardware | 40" outdoor display at goat-eye-level |
| 🪙 Reward | Low-latency pellet dispenser (green zone only) |
| 📊 Logging | Action camera + timestamped behavior logs |

---

## Visual Protocol

**Footage Loop (5 min silent loop):**
1. Goat walks to green-taped area
2. Grazes visibly
3. Avoids red-taped area (clearly marked)
4. After correct graze → shimmer cue → real pellet drops

🟩 Green Zone = Weed Target  
🟥 Red Zone = Do Not Graze

*All visual tape colors must match physical plot layout.*

---

## Trial Setup

- **Plot**: 10m² divided into green/red zones using flag tape
- **Display**: Weatherproof, battery or solar powered
- **Reinforcement**: Pellet reward on 30–60% of correct green-zone grazing
- **Trial Duration**: 15–30 mins, 2× per day, 2 weeks minimum

Success Criteria

Metric	Goal
✅ Green zone grazing	↑ 30% from baseline
❌ Red zone grazing	↓ under 10%
⏱️ Latency to reward	< 3 sec for effective learning
🧠 Repetition	Sustained behavior after 1 week


⸻

Ethics & Notes
	•	No speech or manipulation
	•	Visual-only learning
	•	Micro rewards only; not full feeding
	•	Stop immediately if goats show stress

⸻

Future Extension
	•	Add multi-animal footage to increase social mimicry
	•	Rotate footage to prevent habituation
	•	Connect reward logs to DAO backend (optional)
	•	Run in N = 3 sites for reproducibility
